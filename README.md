## Overview

Practice Bot is a versatile Discord bot developed using Python and the Discord.py library. 
This bot is designed to make your Discord server more engaging and fun, 
with features like joke-telling, voice channel interaction, role management, and more.

## Features

- **Interactive Commands**: Practice Bot responds to various commands, such as `&hello`, `&joke`, `&join`, `&leave`, and more, providing a dynamic experience for your server members.

- **Jokes on Demand**: Need a good laugh? Use the `&joke` command to get a random dad joke delivered right to your server!

- **Voice Channel Integration**: Practice Bot can join and play music in voice channels. Use `&join` to bring the bot into your channel and `&play` to queue up your favorite songs.

- **Role Management**: Easily manage server roles with `&addRole` and `&removeRole` commands, making it simple to assign and revoke roles as needed.

- **Inappropriate Word Filter**: The bot automatically filters out inappropriate words, helping to maintain a friendly server environment.

## Getting Started
